# Bike-Sharing-Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- Building a Linear Regression model to determine the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. The python notebook guides through EDA, Feature selection using RFE technique, detection of multi-collinearity and predictive analysis.
- Understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- The Business Problem/Business Goals that is being handled are below:
  - Build a prediction model to forecast demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  - How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Dataset
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. The data dictionary is also provided for better understanding.
- Dataset- "day.csv"
- Data dictionary - "Readme_dictionary.txt"


## Conclusions
- From the data provided for 2018 and 2019, we can expect the demand to be on increasing side once the situation gets back to normal
- Company should improve and focus on Season: Spring and Winter. 
- Company can introduce new offers in months from February till June to increase their demands, such as Summer offers and high discounts.
